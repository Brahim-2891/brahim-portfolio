        <h3>web Development</h3>
        <p>I'm a passionate police officer with a knack for problem-solving and attention to detail. Alongside my law enforcement career, I've also delved into the world of web development. As a junior web developer proficient in Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS, I've discovered a new avenue for creativity and innovation. With a background in English studies and specialized training in business management, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. Whether it's maintaining law and order or crafting elegant code, I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and grow. Welcome to my portfolio, where you'll find a showcase of my work and projects!

      <p class="contact-message">I have always been deeply passionate about nature and the great outdoors. From the peaceful tranquility of a forest to the awe-inspiring beauty of a mountain peak, nature has always been my sanctuary. Whether it's hiking through lush green forests or simply taking a moment to admire a colorful sunset, I find immense joy and inspiration in the natural world. Through my work, I aim to capture and celebrate the breathtaking beauty of nature, sharing its wonders with others and inspiring a deeper appreciation for our planet's natural treasures.!</p>
